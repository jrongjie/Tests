                <div class="modal-body">
                    <p>Built by Dr. William Monroe Wells in 1926, a doctor who delivered over 5,500 babies and who was, for a time during World War II, the only practicing Black doctor in Orlando, the Wells’Built Hotel served as a place to stay for African-Americans traveling during segregation. Famous Blacks who lodged here include Ella Fitzgerald, Thurgood Marshall, and Jackie Robinson (City of Orlando Historic Preservation n.d., City of Orlando Black Historical Sites n.d., Thompson 2003). The Dr. Wells’ South Street Casino was located next door, and offered entertainment to African-Americans in the area. It featured performances by such famous artists as Count Basie and Duke Ellington. A fire damaged much of the building before it was torn down in 1987. It was also a place for young people to gather to play basketball and skate--during the day. In the evening the adults arrived to see performances by musicians on the “Chitlin’ Circuit” and others (Thompson 2003, Wells’Built Museum n.d.).</p>
                    <p>The Wells’Built hotel is now the site of the Wells’Built Museum of African-American History, which opened in 2009 and holds memorabilia and exhibits on the history of the Black community in Orlando. The Wells’Built Museum is operated by the Association to Preserve African American History and Culture, an organization founded by Florida State Representative Geraldine Thompson (Thompson 2003). In 2001, the Dr. William Monroe Wells home (built by Dr. Wells in 1924) was relocated to become part of the Wells’Built Museum Complex. At their home he and his wife Clifford Irene Wells entertained guests and Mrs. Wells herself was involved in service and civic work in the area (City of Orlando Historic Preservation n.d., City of Orlando Black Historical Sites n.d., Thompson 2003).</p>
